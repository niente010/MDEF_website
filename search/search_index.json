Since the cards proved to be very stimulating, using a multi-step methodology turned fundamental to synthesize just a few key concepts.  For this reason, I first decided to lay all the cards on the table, analyzing them individually. Often, it was necessary to delve deeper into the meaning of some in order to understand them more accurately. Therefore, I proceeded by gradually flipping over the cards that was less relevant for my vision.</p> <p></p> <p>Card by card, I was able to first identify the 2 Weak Signals, then move on to the 3 Areas of Opportunity, and finally, the 2 Random Triggers.  Through this operation, I\u2019ve come to realize how these few cards were able to encapsulate a significant part of my ethos, and how their combination could generate a multitude of ideas.</p> <p> Click here to navigate the AoWS.</p> New Suggestions <p></p> <p>From the considerations that emerged, I identified two new suggestions for the deck: \u201cTechnology at non-humans service\u201d is an invitation to de-anthropocentric design in which machines coexist with the whole biosphere. \u201cBiodesign\u201d, on the other hand, is a stimulus for interdisciplinary design aimed at crossing the boundary between design and natural sciences.</p>"},{"location":"term1/AtlasOfWeakSignals/#multiscalar-personal-design-space","title":"Multiscalar Personal Design Space","text":"<p>The creation of a Design Space starts in definying the multiscalar consciusness of ourselves.
