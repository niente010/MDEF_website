JALEO is a research on circuit bending, the act of modifying already existing, usually wasted or unused electronics to give them a new life. 
In our case, we focused on their conversion into musical instruments or audio-reactive analog visual instruments.
You can have a tease of the instruments that we built with the following jams! 
More detailed materials releasing soon!
