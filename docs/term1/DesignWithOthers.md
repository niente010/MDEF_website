    ## **Introduction** 
    Dividing the seminar into 4 phases (Soil, Land, Connect and Intervene), we were asked to reflect on the benefits and the frictions that interacting with a community leads to. Thanks to the guidance of Holon, we were exposed to different communities around Barcelona, having the chance to collect their experience in working with & within others.

### **Identifying the Issue**

![](../images/DWO01.jpg)

The lack of microspaces for biodiversity in the urban space.
==Why this is an issue?==
- When we don’t see benefit for humans it is very difficoult to plan for biodiversity.
- The biodiversity is still part of the ecosystem of the city, it’s just that it’s ignored.
- Understanding and “apply” biodiversity has the potential to improve the quality of life in the urban space.
- Biofilia.
- The importance of education.
- There is a lack in between data/knowledge and tangible interventions.
    
==Which are the inside conflicts?==
- The side effects of these choiches
- Not everyone has the privilege to question and redefine its behaviour on these topics.
- Finding compromises in between humans/non-humans requires lot of effort, time and care.
- Understanding this topics sometimes requires both systematic and personal changes.

    ## **Reflections**

    Having the opportunity to interact with real communities almost without any filters allowed us to truly grasp what it means to design collaboratively. During our visits, we were able to ==ask questions and directly experience their work environment and projects==, dispelling the mystery that often surrounds the backstages of design studios. This experience provided us with a realistic understanding of both the possibilities and challenges of these approaches, while also introducing us to potential future peers.

    Personally, I've found this experience extremely valuable: although we quickly realized that ==forming a strong bond with communities takes time and energy==, this brief initial engagement has provided the groundwork for building more resilient relationships in the future.
