I had thought that my previous projects gave me a rough idea of what it\u2019s like to design with biology, but I\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve only just scratched the surface.</p> <p>When Nuria introduced us to the possibilities within synthetic biology, I was at a loss for how to react. Some of these experiments seemed like they were straight out of a sci-fi movie, yet they are very much real, and we\u2019re often simply unaware of their existence. What truly captivated me, beyond the biological information itself, were the ethical discussions surrounding these experiments, particularly in synthetic biology. Questions arise about who sets the limits of research and its social implications. Nuria emphasized how people outside the academic sphere are often oblivious and lack agency  in the decision-making process of research, even though the outcomes of this research could significantly alter and intertwine with their lives.</p> <p></p> <p>These reflections also brought to mind a movie that has profoundly influenced me: \u201cCrimes of the Future\u201d by David Cronenberg.  In the movie, there are people who have developed the ability to eat and digest plastic, an evolutionary trait in response to the increasing pollution and pervasiveness of plastic in the environment. These characters represent how the line between natural and artificial is blurring: their ability to consume plastic reflects a deep connection and interdependence with the human-altered environment. Moreover, they are outcasts from society as no-longer-humans, and the movie emphasises the ethics of this choice considering that this ability is actually a benefit to the entire ecosystem. Through these characters, Cronenberg raises questions about the ethics of the mutability of the human body, and the potential future conflicts that these may arise.</p> <p>In the meantime, researching on GMOs has really deepened my understanding of the unique features inherent in every living being. This immense variety of abilities is prompting me to consider our relationship with what enhances our abilities as humans: technology.

I\u2019ve chosen this contrast because it proved to me that the line between fascination and fear for technology is very thin, and it also exposes how technology is never impartial or neutral as we tend to think. It\u2019s interesting, and sometimes scary, that similar technical advancements are in some cases directed towards purposes of violence, power, and control, and at the same time as tools for empathy and playfulness. Aibo also demonstrates our sensitivity towards the design of these artifacts, since an aesthetic that focuses its attention on the eyes allows us to empathize more with it, influencing us with the Kawaii effect; military robots from Boston Dynamics surely evoke different feelings from their design.</p> <p>The letter from 2015 is not a dystopian-future fear, as a similar event was repeated in May 2023 with the 22-words \u201cStatement on AI Risk\u201d, signed by AI scientists, policymakers, and journalists to warn about the risk of extinction that AI could lead to:</p> <p>\u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d</p> <p>I think it\u2019s fundamental not to have an Illuministic approach to new technical developments, but instead a critical one, which enables us to understand how they work behind their black box and to consider their conflicts.

This project made me reflect on a concept highlighted by Taller Estampa during one of their lectures: </p> <p>\u201cAI is the most accurate representation of our society today\u201d.</p> <p>I agree with this statement because the process of developing AI has its roots in datasets and data-mining with the related biases. Since AIs have been trained on this past knowledge, like a psychologist, they are able to track and expose our deep-rooted conflicts.

I found myself enquiring about the reasons behind my care of this triangle of co-existence and how I might immerse myself in these profound topics through my personal experience. I reflected on my daily interactions with machines and non-human entities and realized how machines can enhance our understanding of our relationships with non-humans. They really extend our perception and could act as a medium for connecting with our environment. This inspired me to gather various natural entities around Poblenou \u2014those that caught my eye, the ones I typically overlook in my everyday life and rarely consider. I then used a digital microscope to explore them, establishing a connection among myself (a human), an artificial apparatus (the microscope), and other species (the entities I collected). </p> <p>Viewing these entities through the microscope, I was able to enhance a deeper connection with them, and it was quite touching to observe them so closely. The machine offered more than just a technical feature; it gave me the chance to remember that I am always part of a broader ecosystem, one in which fractal patterns reign.</p> WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INVOLVE YOURSELF? WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU USE YOURSELF AS AN INSTRUMENT? <p>I believe that personal involvement is fueled by one\u2019s own ideals.  When you internalize and believe in these values, you are actively and personally engaged in your pursuits. If these ideals are deeply held, they can help in not getting influenced by side interests, allowing to focus more immersively into your objectives. Moreover, this practice leads to a deeper self-understanding, as constant interaction with our own principles facilitates personal growth and insight.</p> DID ANYTHING CHANGE ABOUT YOUR WAY OF WORKING? <p>I consider myself an idealist, so the idea of guiding my projects through my ideals wasn\u2019t novel to me, however, I\u2019ve come to truly appreciate the importance of constantly documenting the process behind.

An intriguing twist to this assignment was the directive to design it to be as non-functional as possible. This encouraged us to let our creativity run wild and embrace a playful approach. So embraced an audacious and captivating concept: the LifeX, a \u201clife expectancy predictor\u201d.

It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek nod to the dubious claims of some fortune tellers. </p> <p>In truth, an Arduino board is programmed to halt at a random number, influenced by the moment the user activates it. The motor maneuvers the pen across what we playfully dub your \u2018life bookmark\u2019.

The idea of going beneath the surface of our technological devices has always intrigued me: not necessarily to understand every technical detail they offer, but to demystify them and create a more empathetic connection with what we typically consider as \u201cmachines\u201d or \u201ctools\u201d.</p> <p>Reading James Bridle\u2019s \u201cNew Dark Age\u201d was a revelation for me: it helped clarify how we often misconceive digital processes as occurring in some ethereal cloud. Bridle effectively debunks this notion, illustrating how these complex phenomena are inextricably linked to the real world and its resources. This realization is valid not only for physical interfaces, where the opacity often prevents users from understanding, repairing, or modifying the internals, but also for digital interfaces like AI. The opaque nature of AI\u2019s data extraction processes often renders them unquestionable and inaccessible to users.</p> <p>This is why adopting a critical approach towards technology is essential.

There were moments when I felt guilt or discomfort about these privileges, viewing them as something negative about my persona which I couldn\u2019t escape or renounce. Later on, I understood how having privileges doesn\u2019t necessarily entail adopting the behaviours of those who take advantage of their position, instead, these behaviors are shaped by our personal values and awareness.

It was more like discovering them from the inside and feeling connected with them, as they have always been somewhere in me. </p> <p>I didn\u2019t know about the term polycrisis, but I really think it sums up lot of my inner thoughts which i\u2019ve already had in the past. Once taking consciousness of the meaning of the word, it seemed to me very obvious that all these crisis have always been connected to each other.  I think that the most dangerous outcome of the polycrisis is the escalation of hate which carries with it: every individual or community which is affected by one of these crises keeps getting angrier and angrier, trying to find a specific target to blame.  If we multiply this phenomena across the spectrum of the polycrisis, it seems so difficult to imagine a future in which discussion, dialogue and mediation are possible.</p> <p>This ties into the idea of a \u201cgeneral loss of imagination\u201d too. The precarious and critical global state of \u201csurvival\u201d not only generates hate in between each other, but also doesn\u2019t allow us to imagine new alternative futures. </p> <p>Personally, When I first became engaged with ecological issues, my actions were driven by a strong desire to play my part in mitigating the problem. While I still value and participate in such practices, I\u2019ve realized that this approach limited the attention on my feelings, as I believed that making \u201cright\u201d choices alone could have \u201csolved the problem\u201d.

Honestly I\u2019ve never participated to public demonstrations or protests, preferring to form opinions in solitude (which allows to feel much safer).  Even though this was just a small experience, I think it has been a meaningful step in understanding what self exposure really means.  </p> <p>Since I\u2019m naturally inclined towards introspection, often prioritizing thought over action, sometimes it\u2019s not easy for me to act and expose myself in matters I deeply care about. I also had quite low expectations about the experiment, but they immediately turned out to be wrong.  Talking to strangers in a real-world context was truly amazing, giving us the chance to discuss with them peacefully and without any scripts. Their genuine appreciation for our initiative and the constructive interactions that ensued were priceless.</p> <p></p> <p>In a way, this intervention reminded me of \u201cComizi d\u2019Amore\u201d, a movie from 1964 by the Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini.  This movie is one of the first ever \u201cinvestigative film\u201d, in which Pasolini himself went all around Italy asking common people about their views on a delicate and taboo topic of the time: sexuality. He interviewed people from children to elders, and the authenticity and the diversity of their answers is what really makes the viewer feel part of them. The movie highlighted the power and value of open discussion, especially on critical topics, and how it can foster a strong sense of solidarity. </p> <p>I really hope to keep on exposing myself. &lt;3</p>"}]}
