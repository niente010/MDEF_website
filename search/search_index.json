This aim was achieved through the use of a laser cutting machine to weld the sheets, employing a technique derived from the field of Soft Robotics. Given that this technique has been sparsely documented and experimented with, the prototyping phase was all about exploration.  The initial stages of research have focused in meticulously calibrating the machine\u2019s parameters, aiming to establish an effective welding. Following this, the focus shifted towards enhancing the adhesion between the plastic sheets. Various strategies were tested to improve precision and effectiveness in the prototyping process.  The use of acrylic sheets held in place with magnets, the application of preliminary guides, and the implementation of double welding techniques were instrumental in refining the process.  These trials and adjustments (and their documentation) helped to understand the machine as well as the fabrication process in the optimization of a technique.

Key characteristics of populist discourse include: the glorification of the people, estrangement of the elite, exclusion of outsiders who don\u2019t share the same identity, nostalgia for the nation\u2019s symbolic traditions, and a depiction of the leader as the authentic voice of the people. Sophie also used a Natural Language Processing, an Artificial Intelligence model capable of understanding human language, in order to develop a Sentiment Analysis of the selected tweets.  Sophie\u2019s project embeds a broader analysis on communication and the utilization of social media by political parties. Therefore, her prototype aligns with the 3<sup>rd</sup> Role of Prototyping, serving as a tangible demonstration of her research.  After discussing the project together with Sophie, we became aware of the opacity surrounding the way social media curate information for users. These algorithms, which shape our perceptions of news, politics, and culture, operate within a \u201cblack box\u201d, making it challenging for users to decrypt their working.  The connections between pieces of information, and the reasons why certain elements are prioritized over others, remain concealed.</p> <p></p> <p>To address this, we conceived the idea of a browser add-on, powered by AI, that can deconstruct the interface of social networks.  This tool would serve as an overlay, providing insights into why a particular tweet, post, or comment is presented to the user.  Contrary to the common belief that social media and technology are neutral entities, our tool aims to shed light on the underlying biases and conflicts.
