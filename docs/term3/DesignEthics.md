## **Reflections**

technology is kind of everpresent but the perception of it is not.
technosphere: extends the concept of biosphere, the technological context is almost impossible to avoid.
technologies are a materialization of the values a society upholds.
technologies and science have different origins, we have science because we had technologies, because technologies came before.

two different visions of technology:
- technological neutrality: technology can be used for good/bad intentions, but it’s not neutral by itself.
- technological determinism: depending on the main technology the society has, the rest will follow that. defining technology as one of the main drivers of change.

technology change us but not completely, it also depends on us. but also the technology itself influences this. 
that’s why technology assumes a mediating role.

hermeneutic relation: read the world through technology and then decode and interpret.

humans are not the only ones who develop technology, every being develops its own way to survive.
