### **Identifying the Issue**

![](../images/DWO01.jpg)

The lack of microspaces for biodiversity in the urban space.
==Why this is an issue?==
    - When we don’t see benefit for humans it is very difficoult to plan for biodiversity.
    - The biodiversity is still part of the ecosystem of the city, it’s just that it’s ignored.
    - Understanding and “apply” biodiversity has the potential to improve the quality of life in the urban space.
    - Biofilia.
    - The importance of education.
    - There is a lack in between data/knowledge and tangible interventions.
    
==Which are the inside conflicts?==
    - The side effects of these choiches
    - Not everyone has the privilege to question and redefine its behaviour on these topics.
    - Finding compromises in between humans/non-humans requires lot of effort, time and care.
    - Understanding this topics sometimes requires both systematic and personal changes.
