## **Methodology**

![](processTotal.png){: .image-full-width }

For this project we had the opportunity to create a unique workflow: how to have a conversation among 3 characters, in order for one to influence the others and vice-versa? 
We didn’t want to split in groups so we came up with a configuration for our project that was balanced among the three of us, taking inspiration from the geometric shapes that represents this concept: the triangle.
This is how the workflow that we designed works:

### **Step 0: Three Cells**

Three cells, three different backgrounds, three different countries, three different languages. 
We start this path with our own ideals, ambitions and experience.

### **Step 1: Diffuse**

One of the cells starts to share and describe what it’s doing. When we are involved in a project we can express our uncertainties about it, so expose the fragility of it, or if we are very into it, to share with others why it is so important to us and others, the ideals and the strategy behind it. 
In the meantime the other two cells active listen to the first one, trying to perceive as much details as possible.

### **Step 2: Synapsis**

The next step is to create conversations among the two cells. Free from the original cell’s mindset, they are able to interpret the information in their own way and combine this interpretation into a completely new vision. 
The main message will still be there, but with an altered and new shape.

### **Step 3: Feedback**

The last step is to offer back the shared vision to the original cell, in order to provide new insights and stimulate alternative perspectives.

# **ooorganismooo**

## **ooorganismooo: manifesto**

The goal of ooorganismooo is to encourage the research and development of independent technologies with the purpose of understanding and disseminating the study of ecology, in addition to addressing the climate crisis.

Some of the questions that led to the formation of ooorganismooo are:

- *why is it so easy to imagine huge resources being spent on implanting chips inside the human brain?* *why instead is it so absurd to think of investing the same amount of resources in studying our environment?*

- *who decided that creating a metaverse was more important than trying to communicate with other organisms?*

- *why do we give for granted that the price and risks we pay for technological advancements are worth it?* *who decided that this was the right way for humanity to “progress”?*

- *do we really want to leave these responsibilities in the hands of companies whose only interest is to make a profit and maintain the power they hold?*


Some questions ooorganismooo wants to investigate are:

- *is it possible to reduce the distance between the technologies we use and their ecological infrastructures? What differences in the design enhance this entangled relationship?*

 - *can we rethink technologies in such a way that instead of conflicting with our relationship with nature, they help us understand and respect it?*
    
- *can we create tools with the purpose of having a more symbiotic relationship with other living species?*
    
- *can we create new narratives to expose the ecological crisis in a way that stimulates a collective response to it?*
    
ooorganismooo aims to be an ==interdisciplinary group== where specialization gives way to the contamination of knowledge, spaces, and applications.

ooorganismooo believes in ==the narrative and aesthetic power of art and design to connect with scientific research== to spread these scenarios and make more accessible, avoiding academic and corporate gatekeeping.

The strategies used by ooorganismooo include active listening, critical thinking and rapid prototyping, while the tools are open source, following a ==bottom-up strategy==.

Before a technological revolution, ooorganismooo believes that ==the priority should be to offer a cultural revolution==, listening to alternatives to today's reality in order to solidify the foundations for an immediate future.

## **the plan** 
ooorganismooo starts from first-person research of the participants.
By ==mapping different environments operating in the field of art, design, science, and technology==, the goal is to attract the attention of anyone interested in peeking out from their professional background to explore a collective confrontation on the selected themes.
From there, the goal is to ==move from conversations to practicality, stimulating designs and speculations==.
It is important to practice of ==altering the context==, in order to encourage dialogue and break out of respective filters: for example, it would be interesting to explore a rotation of the spatial context during the diverse activities.
