## **FasciNation: Life Under the Regime**

### **Brainstorming**

- Trying to convert and change mind of the most extremist politicians in history.
- Summary/prediction of current politician positions.
- Educational VR game to immerse in an extremist context → 3D objects (diary, final reflections, leave a trace in the 3D world)
- You can’t leave the game (?)
- Interaction may be to ridiculize or to promote discussion.

### **Scenario**

We highlighted how extremist political parties are increasing worldwide, especially focusing on hate speeches and discrimination.
The "solution" we are proposing is to take advantage of open platforms like Dafne to increase discussions in these topics.

### **Governance and Rules**

The idea is an educational tool which shows how life would be living an authoritarian regime.
This tool is a videogame which can be  downloaded from a repository directly from the Dafne platform.
In the game, the player is a journalist who lives in this extreme reality, whose goal is to interact with the world and the other characters.
The dialogues with the characters are recorded on a notebook, as well as the player observations on the interactions.

### **Artifact**

At the end of the game, the page of the notebook with the reflections becomes the resulting artifact from the experience.
The user is also prompted to create an avatar of the extremist leader that represents the world which they have visited. These avatars are then minted as NFTs and distributed on the platform.
This 3D object becomes an NFT, each of these collection showing a personal point of view and reflection on the topic in order to promote discussion.
The funds raised from the sale of the these NFTs would be distributed by a DAO towards de-radicalisation efforts.
