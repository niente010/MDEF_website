## **Reflection**

The "Documenting Design" seminar is enriching our ability to keep track of our impressions, learnings and personal reflections throughout the programme. We are encouraged to embrace documentation as a ==continuous flow==, that should persist without pause.

In doing so, even if our work is sometimes imperfect or unfinished, we enable a ==transparent interpretation of our experience==, placing a focus on the ==process== itself, the real protagonist of our programme.
Therefore, this methodology enhance us in using a ==introspective and reflective approach== within our design practice.
Documenting also gives us the chance to employ a ==variety of strategies and tools== like coding, photo and video editing and sketching.
