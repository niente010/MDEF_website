### **Forensic Questions**

- ==WHAT DOES IT DO?==

    A 3D printer is a device that creates three-dimensional objects by layering material based on a digital design. Using a computer-aided design (CAD) model as a blueprint, the printer adds material layer by layer, whether it's thermoplastic, resin, or metal, to form a solid object. Different printing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), dictate the type of material and the layering process, resulting in a tangible product that mirrors the digital design.
    <br></br>

- ==HOW DOES IT WORK?==

    The 3D printer works by interpreting a digital 3D model, slicing it into thin horizontal layers using specialized software, and then building the object layer by layer through additive manufacturing. Depending on the technology used, the printer deposits material, such as thermoplastic filament, liquid resin, or metal powder, layer by layer, with each layer fusing to the one below. The material is solidified using various methods like heating, UV curing, or laser sintering, resulting in a three-dimensional object that matches the digital design.
    <br></br>

- ==HOW IS IT BUILT?== 

    The 3D printer is constructed using a combination of mechanical, electronic, and software components. Mechanically, it features a frame that houses the moving parts, including the print head or extruder, and a build platform. These components are driven by motors, guided by linear rails or rods, ensuring precise movements on the X, Y, and Z axes. Electronically, a main control board processes digital instructions from the slicing software, directing the motors and regulating the temperature of the print head or curing source. Additionally, various sensors monitor conditions like temperature and filament presence, while the software interface allows users to configure settings, load models, and initiate the printing process.
    <br></br>

- ==WHY IT FAILED, OR IT WASN'T USED ANYMORE?==

    The 3D printer still functions, but it's an older, unstable model with low accuracy and print quality.

### **Steps Taken**

1. Cleaned the dust off the printer and brought it to the MDEF room.
2. Disassembled using our toolbox.
3. Separated into three main parts as follows:
    - ==PLATE==: Horizontal surface that also gets heated and can be moved in all directions and where the plastic is  printed on;
    - ==STRUCTURE==: The part that supports the entire printing machine;
    - ==EXTRUDER==: Contains the motors to print 3D filament;
4. Laid out all parts individually and documented.
