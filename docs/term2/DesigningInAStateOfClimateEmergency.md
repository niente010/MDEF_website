    ### Positionality

    One of the first steps of the week was to assess our positionality statement. Personally, it was not my first time discussing about the concepts of privilege and power, but something in these collective talks helped me to have a deeper consciousness.

    I've been fairly aware of my privileges, but this consciousness led me to different reactions over time. 
    There were moments when I felt guilt or discomfort about these privileges, viewing them as something negative about my persona which I couldn't escape or renounce.
    Later on, I understood how having privileges doesn’t necessarily entail adopting the behaviours of those who take advantage of their position, Instead, these behaviors are shaped by our personal values and awareness. The "wheel of Power/Privilege" was a useful tool in reminding me of my place in the world and in finding peace with it.

    ### (De)Growth/Polycrisis/Loss of Imagination
    
    Acknowledging these words during the seminar has not felt as learning them from a dictionary. It was more like discovering them from the inside and feeling connected with them, as they have always been somewhere inside me. 

    I didn’t know about the term polycrisis, but I really think it sums up lot of my inner thoughts which i’ve already had in the past. Once taking consciousness of the meaning of the word, it seemed to me very obvious that all these crisis have always been connected to each other. 
    I think that the most dangerous outcome of the polycrisis is the escalation of hate which carries with it: every individual or community which is affected by one of these crises keeps getting angrier and angrier, trying to find a specific target to blame. 
    If we multiply this phenomena across the spectrum of the polycrisis, it seems so difficult to imagine a future in which discussion, dialogue and mediation are possible.

    This ties into the idea of a "general loss of imagination" too. The precarious and critical global state of “survival” not only generates hate in between each other, but also doesn’t allow us to imagine new alternative futures. 

    Personally, When I first became engaged with ecological issues, my actions were driven by a strong desire to play my part in mitigating the problem. While I still value and participate in such practices, I've realized that this approach limited the attention on my feelings, as I believed that making "right" choices alone could have “solved the problem”. 
    Imagination is as important as reflective choices to keep the hope alive.
