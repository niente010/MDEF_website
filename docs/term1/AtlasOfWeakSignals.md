# Atlas of Weak Signals

## Weak Signals and Design Space

Weak signals are an early indicator of change, a small inflection that has the potential to evolve into something more influential.
Weak Signals can help in identifying our own ==Design Space==: a navigational tool in the design practice to ground directions.
The Design Space is a ==visual collection== of projects, references, case studies, materials, used to define ideas and create links.

The key roles of Design Space:

- ==SITUATING==: understand the surroundings and allowing links within to arise.
- ==ORGANIZATIONAL==: reducing complexity, trying to make sense and see which connections arise.
- ==NARRATIVE==: understand your own narrative.
- ==PERFORMATIVE or PARTICIPATIVE==: performative as giving feedback to oneself and participative as combining design spaces.
- ==INSPIRATIONAL==

The goal is to translate this ==abstract weak signals== into ==actual emergent realities==.
