## **Introduction: Circuit Bending**

JALEO is a research on Circuit Bending, the act of modifying existing, often discarded, electronics to give them new life. 

The first step was to collect raw materials: we looked around for unused, non-working, discarded digital cameras, toys and monitors. Some of these electronics were gifted by friends, many picked up from trash or bought cheaply at Dels Encants.

Then it was time to get hands-on: the process of circuit bending is a delicate balance between freestyle experimentation and reverse engineering. Our process involved freely searching for glitches, features, and distortions in the original hardware, while at the same time preserving and not damaging the original components. It is a trial-and-error procedure that can yield unexpected results, both in terms of unlocking new features in the device and potentially breaking it completely.

This unpredictability is precisely why we are fascinated by this technique and find it unique: it dances on the spectrum of possibilities and experiments and designs over something that already exists, creating a methodology based on adaptability, hacking, reusing, and recycling—concepts that are difficult to find in other contexts.
This vision also requires care and attention, creating a magical tension between what the artifact could or could not become. 

## **Sound and Visual Instruments**

### **Valentino**
Valentino (https://github.com/niente010/Valentino) is our first accomplished instrument, an experiment that passed away and came back to life multiple times due to its fragility, but eventually turned into a powerful sound and beat-making instrument.
