Since the cards proved to be very stimulating, using a multi-step methodology turned fundamental to synthesize just a few key concepts.  For this reason, I first decided to lay all the cards on the table, analyzing them individually.

Accompanied by a videogame experience, the device facilitates consistent exercise and enables doctors to monitor rehabilitation progress.   Prototyping has been a fundamental tool that allowed to refine the product design and functionality.

SPIRA \u2192 THE PROCESS OF PROTOTYPING AS A VEHICLE FOR INQUIRY: During the development of SPIRA the goal was to fabricate closed chambers from upcycled plastic sheets, which would serve as habitats for microalgae cultivation. This aim was achieved through the use of a laser cutting machine to weld the sheets, employing a technique derived from the field of Soft Robotics. Given that this method has been sparsely documented and experimented with, the prototyping phase was all about exploration.  The initial stages of research have focused in meticulously calibrating the machine\u2019s parameters, aiming to establish an effective welding. Following this, the focus shifted towards enhancing the adhesion between the plastic sheets. Various strategies were tested to improve precision and effectiveness in the prototyping process.  The use of acrylic sheets held in place with magnets, the application of preliminary guides, and the implementation of double welding techniques were instrumental in refining the process.  These trials and adjustments (and their documentation) helped to understand the machien as well as the fabrication process in the optimization of a technique.</p> <p>Click here to visit SPIRA\u2019s page.</p>"},{"location":"term1/DesignStudio01/#extended-workspace","title":"Extended Workspace","text":""},{"location":"term1/DocumentingDesign/","title":"Documenting Design","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>FACULTY: Josep Marti, Pablo Zunaga </p> <p>CALENDAR 02-10 \u2192 \u2026</p> <p>TRACK: Reflection</p> <p>Bug</p> <p>\u2026Work in Progress\u2026</p>"},{"location":"term1/Landing/","title":"Landing","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>FACULTY: Tomas Diez, Laura Benitez</p> <p>CALENDAR: 02-10 \u2192 08-10</p> <p>TRACK: Application</p> <p>Bug</p> <p>\u2026Work in Progress\u2026</p>"}]}
