- ==HOW WILL YOU LIVE TOGETHER?== <br></br>
    Each day, me and Re.flection² will designate a specific time to engage with one another. Re.flection² will position itself between me and my mirror, and through its core, an hypnotic rotating fan, we’ll have the chance to shed our tendencies to overthink, guiding our focus towards seeking inner tranquility.
    <br></br>

- ==WHAT DOES IT NOTICE?== <br></br>
    Re.flection² aids in interrupting the regular flow of my thoughts, prompting a moment in which to breathe and find calm. Its repetitive motion and its filtering materials allow us to do that.
    <br></br>

- ==WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?== <br></br>
    Upon my initial encounter with Re.flection², I was struck by how its semi-transparent layer could perfectly encapsulate the notion of feeling sheltered. Protection is not about hiding, it’s about embracing the complexity and contradictions that reside beneath our surface. Positioning Re.flection² before a mirror is a method of confronting our personal selves and making peace with that vision. <br></br>


- ==WHY DOES IT MATTER?== <br></br>
    For me, Re.flection² serves as a tangible reminder of the importance of dedicating time to oneself. <br></br>
