I'm Nicol√≤ Baldi, Designer and Photographer born in 1999. 
After graduating in Product Design at University of Bologna, I'm now part of Master in Design for Emergent Futures at IaaC in Barcelona. This virtual space is dedicated to insights and the process behind my projects. **[my website](https://community.emergentfutures.io/courses/5566525/content)**
