## **Introduction: Circuit Bending**

JALEO is a research on Circuit Bending, the act of modifying existing, often discarded, electronics to give them new life. 

The first step was to collect raw materials: we looked around for unused, non-working, discarded digital cameras, toys and monitors. Some of these electronics were gifted by friends, many picked up from trash or bought cheaply at Dels Encants.

Then it was time to get hands-on: the process of circuit bending is a delicate balance between ==freestyle experimentation and reverse engineering==. Our process involved freely searching for ==glitches, new features, and distortions== in the original hardware, while at the same time preserving and not damaging the original components. It is a ==trial-and-error procedure== that can yield unexpected results, both in terms of unlocking new features in the device and potentially breaking it completely.

This ==unpredictability== is precisely why we are fascinated by this technique and find it unique: it dances on the spectrum of possibilities and experiments and designs over something that already exists, creating a ==methodology based on adaptability, hacking, reusing== — concepts  difficult to find and apply in other contexts.
This vision also requires care and attention, creating a magical tension between what the artifact could or could not become. 

## **People & Spaces**
The project emerged in between and thanks to a vibrant group of people which organically emerged during our research.
We started by getting in touch with sound experimenting communities and artists in Barcelona. 
We visited their spaces and studios, attended their performances, jammed together, grabbed coffees and simply shared our experiences. 

It was amazing to see how all those people were so available and open to us to share their point of view, stories, spaces and knowledge with us.
To me the best is that all of these relationships grew without any force, but instead in a very spontaneous way driven by the same passion for experimentation in soundscapes.
Sometimes some of them even happened randomly, but that eventually created a solid group without which this project would have never been possible. 
Some of them were an incredible inspiration to us, and others even became part of actively collaborating to our performance. We would truly love to share our appreciation to this people and their kindness, sincerity and patience.

## **Sound and Visual Instruments**

==VALENTINO==

: Valentino is our first accomplished instrument, an experiment that passed away and came back to life multiple times due to its fragility, but eventually turned into a powerful sound and beat-making instrument. 
You can find the full documentation of the making of Valentino through [this link](https://github.com/niente010/Valentino).

==LA ROCA==
La Roca has been developed together with Anthuanet Falcon and Enric Aranda during the Workshop: Installaciò Sonora, organized by Mutan Monkey. 
The goal was to explore the concept of sound installations, a world which i didnt know the existence before, and focus on the huge potential of amplified primitive sounds. 
This is why La Roca amplifies the sound of a motor hitting a rock with various speeds through a piezo microphone, creating a combination of metallic, industrial sounds with the natural reverb and material of the rock.

==AIRBOOSTER==
The Airbooster is an Airbus toy of which we reassemble the structure to host a Booster (Pre-Amplifier) effect.
The need to build a booster came from our use of Piezo Microphones, a kind of microphones able to capture physical vibration. Usually this signal is very low though, and that is why we decided to build a circuit for a pre-amp available online, a clone of the Super Hard-On by Z.Vex guitar pedal. We were able to reuse the original case of the toy as well as LEDs.

## **Alquimia**

!!! note "" 
    JALEO has been officially presented during the event Alquimia in SSuave3000, on the 12-06-24.
    This event has been organized by part of the MDEFest 2024, the collective presentation of all the projects developed by this year's Master in Design for Emergent Futures Programme.

    ### **Concept**

    We are liv*ing* in-between as be*ing* a presence in the present: stay*ing* in between is a process of Transform-Action, a dynamic happen*ing* of alchemy. 
    It's oscillat*ing* across dichotomies to find rebirth, the rebirth of mean*ing*, experienc*ing*, feel*ing.*

    The Transform-Action itself is a a process of rebirth*ing*. 

    The presence in the present is a gathering space to feel safe and take care (of), where choosing and imperfections are allowed because it is ever-changing. It’s a humble and hopeful belief that this space can grow exactly here in symbiosis.

    Being in-between does not mean to find a margin and choose a point on this line, but mov*ing* freely in a grey area not clearly defined. It's not only guided by knowledge and rationality, but also by instinct, feel and sense. 

    The start*ing* point to reach this grey area is material, tangible, but at the same time ready to be reconsidered through virtuality.

### **Open Collective Jam**

After delving in a very intense protoyping phase, we asked ourselves how to better communicate and share our project with other people. 
We reflected on the very nature of or process, and we realized that the instruments that we built were very different from the usual concept of musical instrument that we have. 
In fact, this devices can be played without any rules, in an interaction where it is difficult to define what is wrong and what is right. This free experimentation allows anyone to play sounds, with a different interaction compared to traditional instruments in which the interface, the architecture and the cultural background of the instrument might intimidate potential interactions. 
We believe that the open structure and the lack of rules that define the instruments that we built can allow a more accessible and easy-going approach, compared to traditional instruments which usually may communicate the necessity of a particular knowledge first.

This is the reason why, for our presentation, we planned what we called "Open Collective Jam", in which all the instruments were available to everyone to play with, in order to create a gathering moment to jam together. 
The objective was to let the collective sounds, noise and process of discovering be the protagonists and be shared among all the participants, instead of the individual musical skills.
Everybody was invited to put their hands-on and experiment with the different sounds that could be generated by our bizzare creations. It was nice to see the different reactions to the open interfaces and electronics of this devices, and how people were discovering them simply by trying.

### **Live**
After sharing this moment of co-creation, we also thought that it would have been nice to communicate our personal process of experimenting with those instruments, by designing and performing an Audio/Visual Live Performance of JALEO.

We designed the set in order to reflect our process: the idea was to communicate very explicitly our experimentation by including every artifact we built as part of the performance. Even though the performance has been mostly improvised, we had to find a way to include and distribute our tools and their features during the whole lenght of it in order to better highlight their unique features, in order to every of them to have its own role, exactly in the same way as each of them was so important to us during the prototyping phase.
